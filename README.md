# Nakama Swift

[Swift Client SDK API Reference](https://heroiclabs.github.io/nakama-swift/)

**Nakama Swift is not complete - looking for community contributions.**

The current version of the Nakama Swift SDK is not feature-complete to use with Nakama v2 or Nakama v3 released in January 2021. We are asking for community maintainers to open PR or alternatively send us an [email](support@heroiclabs.com) if interested in updating and maintaining the SDK on par with other official Nakama Client Libraries.
